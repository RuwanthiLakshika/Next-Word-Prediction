# Next-Word-Prediction Project

This project aims to build a next-word prediction model using deep learning techniques. Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the most likely next word.

## Description

The Next-Word-Prediction project leverages a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to learn patterns in text data. It is trained on a large corpus of sentences and can be used for various applications, such as autocomplete suggestions, chatbots, and more.

## Usage

1. Load the trained model.
2. Input a sequence of words.
3. Get predictions for the next word(s).
